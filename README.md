# Human-pose-estimation
Human pose estimation is process of estimation of baody pose in the images and videos.In our project we have used open neural network exchange methode for estimation of pose.<br>
Problem statement: To determine the human pose(keypoints like joints,elbows) in images and video.<br>
Solution: Using open neural network exchange  and computer vision technique finds the poses.<br>
Applications: Some of the applications of pose estimation are:<BR>Activity recognition<BR> Action detection<BR> Human tracking<BR>In movies and animation<BR> Virtual reality<BR> Human-computer interaction
